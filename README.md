# ü¶Ö StackHawk CircleCI Orb

The CircleCI Orb, [`stackhawk/stackhawk`](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/stackhawk/stackhawk) makes it easy to integrate StackHawk into your continuous integration pipeline.

## About StackHawk
[StackHawk](https://stackhawk.com) provides dynamic application vulnerability scanning from development to production.

  * ‚ö° Dynamic Application Scanning: Use HawkScan for dynamic vulnerability scanning of your web apps. Think of it as continuous pen testing or security integration testing. Get started with your first scan in minutes.
  * ü¶∏‚Äç Ô∏èBuilt for Modern Dev Teams: Automate scans with Docker commands, manage configs via YAML, and add app scanning as a build stage. We're built for dev teams that care about security and quality.
  * üß∞ Vulnerability Management: (coming soon!) Document for compliance. Prioritize and manage fixes with integrations to existing ticketing tools. No more quarterly pen test PDFs - there is a better way.

Use the HawkScan command line tool to run application scans manually or through automation. Use the stackhawk/stackhawk Orb to make it simple to run it in CircleCI.

## Sign Up
To use this Orb, you must have a StackHawk API key. [Sign up](https://stackhawk.com) to get yours.

## Configure HawkScan
To scan your application, you will need a `stackhawk.yml` configuration file in your application source repository. [Read the docs](https://docs.stackhawk.com/) for more details.

## KAAKAWW!
That is all.
