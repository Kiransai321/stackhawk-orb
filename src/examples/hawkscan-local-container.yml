  In this example, we run Nginx as a Docker container to be scanned within the CircleCI build environment.

  We run the `stackhawk/hawkscan-local` job with the parameter `docker-network: scan_net` to tell HawkScan to run on
  the Docker named network, `scan_net`.

  We also provide the parameter `steps` to do the following before the scan runs:
    1) Create a named Docker bridge network, `scan_net`
    2) Run an Nginx container on that network with the name `nginx_test`

  In our HawkScan configuration, we add our test subject, the nginx container, as `app.host: http://nginx_test`.
  This example assumes you have stored your StackHawk API key as a protected environment variable, `HAWK_API_KEY`.

usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    stackhawk: stackhawk/stackhawk@x.y
  workflows:
    scan-local:
      jobs:
        - stackhawk/hawkscan-local:
            docker-network: scan_net
            steps:
              - run:
                  name: Create scan_net Network
                  command: docker network create scan_net
              - run:
                  name: Run Local Test Instance, nginx_test, on the scan_net Network
                  command: docker run --rm --detach --network scan_net --name nginx_test nginx
