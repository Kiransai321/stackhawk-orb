  In this example, run a scan against a remote target host defined in `stackhawk.yml` at the base of the source
  repository.

  Run stackhawk/hawkscan-remote with the configuration-files parameter, `stackhawk.yml stackhawk-circleci.yml`. This
  tells HawkScan to use the `stackhawk.yml` configuration file found at the base of the source repository, and to
  overlay it with configurations in `stackhawk-circleci.yml`.

  Finally, add the host parameter, `http://example.com`. This adds a HOST environment variable to the HawkScan container
  which may be interpolated in the `stackhawk.yml` configuration file.

usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    stackhawk: stackhawk/stackhawk@x.y
  workflows:
    scan-remote:
      jobs:
        - stackhawk/hawkscan-remote:
            configuration-files: stackhawk.yml stackhawk-circleci.yml
            host: http://example.com
