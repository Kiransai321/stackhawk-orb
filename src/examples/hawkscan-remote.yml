  In this example, we will run a standard HawkScan scan against a target host defined in your `stackhawk.yml`
  configuration file within your source repository. In your case, this should be an integration environment
  accessable to CircleCI. In this example, it's just `http://example.com`

  This example assumes you have stored your StackHawk API key as a protected environment variable, HAWK_API_KEY.

usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    stackhawk: stackhawk/stackhawk@x.y
  workflows:
    scan-remote:
      jobs:
        - stackhawk/hawkscan-remote
