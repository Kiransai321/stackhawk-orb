  In this example, we will run a standard HawkScan scan against a target host defined in your `stackhawk.yml`
  configuration file within your source repository. This should be an integration environment
  accessable to CircleCI. Just as an example, we also add a second overlay configuration file, `stackhawk-circlci.yml`.

  This example assumes you have stored your StackHawk API key as a protected environment variable, `HAWK_API_KEY`.

usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    stackhawk: stackhawk/stackhawk@x.y
  workflows:
    scan-remote:
      jobs:
        - stackhawk/hawkscan-remote:
            configuration-files: stackhawk.yml stackhawk-circleci.yml
